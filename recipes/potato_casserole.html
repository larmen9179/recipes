    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For those days when you need double the comfort! This creamy, cheesy potato dish has twice the yumminess with Cheddar and Jack cheeses.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound thin bacon</li>
        <li>16 russet potatoes</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>4 sticks (1 pound) salted butter, plus more for buttering baking dish</li>
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>2 cups grated Cheddar or Jack (or a mix of both), plus more for topping</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>6 green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon in a saute pan until crispy; let cool and then crumble.</li>
        <li>Scrub the potatoes, then place them on baking sheets. Rub the potatoes with the canola oil and bake until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the potatoes and lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Slice the butter into pats and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add the bacon and sour cream. With a sharp knife, cut each potato in half lengthwise and scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl. Tear up 3 of the skins and throw them in. Smash the potatoes with a potato masher. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and some salt and pepper and mix together well.</li>
        <li>Butter a baking dish, and then spoon the mixture into the dish, top with more grated cheese and bake until warmed through, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
