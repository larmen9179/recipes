    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5lbs of 80/20 ground beef</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>8 slices of bacon</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (Any)</li>
        <li>4 soft hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup spicy ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the beef into 4 patties, each about 5-inches in diameter. Sprinkle the outside of the patties generously with salt and pepper and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Lay the bacon in a large nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat, until brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off and reserve all but about 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and increase the heat to medium-high.
        </li>
        <li>Add the burgers to the skillet, and cook until well browned on the outside and medium-rare on the inside, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked burgers to a rimmed baking sheet and top each with a slice of cheese. Brush the insides of the buns with the melted butter and put on a second baking sheet buttered side-up. Bake until the cheese melts, about 3 minutes and the buns are lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, wipe out the skillet. Heat 1 tablespoon of the reserved bacon drippings over medium-high heat. Break the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Put a burger patty on each of the bottom buns and top each with 2 slices of bacon and a fried egg. Spread the top bun with some of the spicy ketchup and put on top of the burger.</li>
    </ol>
